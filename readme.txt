This is a graphic hangman game. The game chooses random words from a list of words and asks you to find them in 10 turns. One of the programmer's goals is to rewrite the same project with different, richer code. I previously published only the text mode of the game. What is done here is to write a simple game as a class and add a 10-frame gif file. The game allows the choice of 3 to 10 letter words. Make sure the dictionary and graphic file are in the same folder. Those who want only the text mode of the game can ask.
enjoy
